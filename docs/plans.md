## Implementation Rules

- **Order:** write failing test → implement → verify passes → commit
- **Commit format:** `feat:` / `fix:` / `test:` / `chore:` (Conventional Commits)
- **One commit per task** — small and focused
- **Update this file** after each task: tick the checkbox, commit alongside the code

## Feature 5: Student Auth & Profile ✅ Done

### Dependency: none — implement before Sub-2, Sub-3, Sub-4

### Task 1: Database migration
**Files:** `web/db/schema.ts`, `web/db/migrations/NNNN_student_auth.sql`

- [x] Add `students` table to schema (id, username, pin_hash, display_name, created_by, created_at, last_active_at)
- [x] Add `student_stats` table (student_id, current_streak, longest_streak, total_games, total_correct, total_answered, last_played_date, consecutive_perfect, badges JSONB)
- [x] Add `student_question_stats` table (student_id, quiz_id, question_id, correct_count, wrong_count, ease_factor, last_seen_at)
- [x] Add nullable `student_id` column to `attempts` table
- [x] Write SQL migration file and run against local DB
- [x] Commit: `chore: add students, student_stats, student_question_stats tables; add student_id to attempts`

### Task 2: NextAuth — student credentials provider
**Files:** `web/src/auth.ts`, `web/src/types/quiz.ts`

- [x] Add `Student`, `StudentStats`, `Badge` types to `quiz.ts`
- [x] Extend NextAuth JWT/session types: `role: 'teacher' | 'student'`, `studentId?`, `username?`
- [x] Add `"student-credentials"` provider: `SELECT * FROM students WHERE username = ?` → `bcrypt.compare(pin, pin_hash)`
- [x] Ensure existing teacher credentials provider is unchanged
- [x] Write unit test: valid PIN → session created; wrong PIN → null returned
- [x] Commit: `feat: add student-credentials NextAuth provider`

### Task 3: Middleware update
**Files:** `web/src/middleware.ts`

- [x] Add rule: `/student/*` requires `session.user.role === 'student'` → redirect `/student/login`
- [x] Existing rule for `/teacher/*` unchanged
- [x] Write E2E test: unauthenticated `/student/profile` → redirected to `/student/login`
- [x] Commit: `feat: protect /student/* routes in middleware`

### Task 4: Student self-registration API
**Files:** `web/src/app/api/student/register/route.ts`

- [x] `POST /api/student/register` body: `{ display_name, username, pin }`
- [x] Validate: username 3–20 chars, lowercase, no spaces; PIN exactly 6 digits
- [x] Check username uniqueness → 409 if taken
- [x] `bcrypt.hash(pin, 12)` → `INSERT INTO students` → `INSERT INTO student_stats`
- [x] Write unit test: valid input → 201; duplicate username → 409; bad PIN → 400
- [x] Commit: `feat: add student self-registration API`

### Task 5: Student login & register pages
**Files:** `web/src/app/student/login/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/student/register/page.tsx`

- [x] Login page: username input + 6-digit PIN input → `signIn('student-credentials')` → redirect `/student/profile`
- [x] Login error: "Invalid username or PIN."
- [x] Register page: display_name + username + PIN → `POST /api/student/register` → auto sign-in → redirect `/student/profile`
- [x] E2E test: register → login → redirected to profile
- [x] Commit: `feat: add student login and register pages`

### Task 6: Teacher student management API
**Files:** `web/src/app/api/students/route.ts`, `web/src/app/api/students/[id]/route.ts`, `web/src/app/api/students/[id]/reset-pin/route.ts`

- [x] `GET /api/students` → list students created by authenticated teacher
- [x] `POST /api/students` body `{ display_name }` → auto-generate username + random 6-digit PIN → INSERT → return `{ username, pin }` plaintext once
- [x] Username generation: `display_name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')` + suffix on collision
- [x] `DELETE /api/students/[id]` → verify ownership → DELETE (cascades)
- [x] `POST /api/students/[id]/reset-pin` → generate new PIN → bcrypt hash → UPDATE → return `{ pin }` plaintext once
- [x] Write unit tests: create, duplicate username collision, delete, reset PIN
- [x] Commit: `feat: add teacher student management API`

### Task 7: Teacher students management page
**Files:** `web/src/app/teacher/students/page.tsx`

- [x] Table: username, display_name, PIN column (shown once on create/reset then `——`), Reset button, Delete button
- [x] "+ Add Student" inline form: display_name input + Add button → row appears with PIN visible
- [x] Reset PIN: replaces PIN in row with new one, hides after next render
- [x] Delete: removes row immediately, calls `DELETE /api/students/[id]`
- [x] E2E test: add student → PIN shown → delete student
- [x] Commit: `feat: add teacher student management page`

### Task 8: Streak logic
**Files:** `web/src/lib/streak.ts`

- [x] `updateStreak(stats: StudentStats, today: Date): Partial<StudentStats>`
  - `last_played_date` = yesterday → `current_streak + 1`

- [x] Write unit tests: yesterday, today, 2-day gap, first play
- [x] Commit: `feat: add streak update logic`

### Task 9: Badge evaluation logic
**Files:** `web/src/lib/badges.ts`

- [x] Write unit test for each badge condition
- [x] Commit: `feat: add badge evaluation logic`

### Task 10: Update attempts route to link student + update stats

- [x] After insert: call `updateStreak()` + `evaluateBadges()` → atomic UPDATE to `student_stats`
- [x] Update `student_question_stats`: increment `correct_count` or `wrong_count` per answer
- [x] Anonymous attempts (`student_id = null`) unchanged
- [x] Write unit test: student attempt → stats updated; anon attempt → stats unchanged
- [x] Commit: `feat: link student_id to attempts and update student stats on submit`

### Task 11: Student profile page
